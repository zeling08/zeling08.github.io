## Abstract
Due to the strong interference of metal environment on electromagnetic signals, the integrated antenna on turbine blade surface has become a key technology in the research and development of passive wireless high temperature temperature temperature sensor for intelligent aeroengine. The simulation and experiment of integrated antenna on turbine blade surface show that the longer the length of integrated antenna on metal surface, the lower the resonant frequency of the antenna, but the more easily it is disturbed by the metal environment. The width of integrated antenna on metal surface can change the input impedance, thus improving the matching effect of the antenna, but the wider the width of the antenna, the narrower the bandwidth of the antenna. In addition, three integrated antennas with the logo pattern of Shanghai Jiaotong University are designed and fabricated. The maximum size of the integrated antenna is less than 22mm, and the lowest echo loss can reach -21.39dB. The simulation directivity coefficient can reach 9.79, which shows the potential of the logo antenna of Shanghai Jiaotong University applied in the metal environment of turbine blades
